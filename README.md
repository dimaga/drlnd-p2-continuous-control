# Project 2: Continuous Control
### Project Details

This is my solution to Continuous Control Project of Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning course. Original project template is available at https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/p2_continuous-control

TODO: The README describes the the project environment details (i.e., the state and action spaces, and when the environment is considered solved).

Besides README.md, this repository holds of the following files:

* __Report.md__ provides a description of the implementation

TODO: List all available files

### Getting Started

Follow the steps, described in https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/dc65050c8f47b365560a30a112fb84f762005c6b README.md, Dependencies section, to deploy your development environment for this project.

Basically, you will need:

* Python 3.6
* PyTorch 0.4.0
* Numpy and Matplotlib, compatible with PyTorch
* Unity ML Agents. Udacity Navigation Project requires its own version of this environment, available https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/dc65050c8f47b365560a30a112fb84f762005c6b/python with references to other libraries

The project has been developed and tested on Mac OS Catalina with a CPU version of PyTorch 0.4.0, and in Udacity Workspace with a CUDA version of PyTorch.

### Instructions

1. Download the project to your PC

2. Open your terminal, cd to the project folder

TODO: The README describes how to run the code in the repository, to train the agent.
