# Project 2: Continuous Control
### Learning Algorithm

TODO: The report clearly describes the learning algorithm, along with the chosen hyperparameters. It also describes the model architectures for any neural networks.

### Plot of Rewards

TODO: A plot of rewards per episode is included to illustrate that the agent is able to receive an average reward (over 100 episodes, and over all 20 agents) of at least +30.

TODO: The submission reports the number of episodes needed to solve the environment.

### Ideas for Future Work

TODO: The submission has concrete future ideas for improving the agent's performance.
